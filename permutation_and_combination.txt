PERMUTATION (Hoan vi)

Formulas for Permutations:

With repetition
- nPn = n^n
- nPr = n^r

Without repetition
- nPn = n!
- nPr = n!/(n â€“ r)!

Example:
n = 4 (A, B, C and D); r = 2
=> 4!/(4-2)! = 12
[AB, AC, AD, BA, BC, BD, CA, CB, CD, DA, DB, DC]

COMBINATION (To hop)

Formulas for Combinations:

Without repetition
- nCr = nPr/r! = n! / (r!(n - r)!)

With repetition
- nCr = (n + r - 1)! / (r!(n - 1)!)

Example:
n = 4 (A, B, C, D); r = 2 (All combinations of size 2)
=> 4!/((4-2)!*2!) = 6
[AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD]
